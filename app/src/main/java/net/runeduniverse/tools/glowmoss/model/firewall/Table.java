/*
 * Tables are containers for chains, sets and stateful objects. They are identified by their address family and
 * their name. The address family must be one of ip, ip6, inet, arp, bridge, netdev. The inet address family is
 * a dummy family which is used to create hybrid IPv4/IPv6 tables. The meta expression nfproto keyword can be
 * used to test which family (ipv4 or ipv6) context the packet is being processed in. When no address family is
 * specified, ip is used by default. The only difference between add and create is that the former will not
 * return an error if the specified table already exists while create will return an error.
